---

##  Features
- Implemented a custom CNN with **two convolutional blocks** and a linear classifier  
- Trained on FashionMNIST with **~90% test accuracy** after 5 epochs  
- Visualized training loss/accuracy curves  
- Evaluated performance using a **confusion matrix**  
- Displayed **sample predictions** (correct vs incorrect highlighted)  
- Supports **GPU acceleration (CUDA)** if available
